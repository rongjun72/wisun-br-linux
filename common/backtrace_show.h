/*
 * backtrace_show() smartly decodes the backtrace and displays it. Thanks to
 * backtrace.h, the .eh_frames binary section is used to decode the stack
 * frames. Then:
 *   - if the debug symbols are available (ie. compiled with -g),
 *     backtrace_show() will resolve the symbol names, the filenames and the
 *     line numbers.
 *   - if the binary is not stripped, backtrace_show() will only resolve the
 *     symbol names.
 *   - if the binary is a shared library or if the binary is compiled with
 *     -rdynamic, backtrace_show() will resolve the names of the exported
 *     symbols only (static functions won't be available)
 *
 * This function is usually called from assert handler but it can be called from
 * any part of the code without disturbing the application. It can be useful
 * during debug.
