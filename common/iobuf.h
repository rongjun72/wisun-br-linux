/*
 * Helper structures to pack/unpack data in buffers. It provides two different
 * APIs: write and read.
 *
 * For writing, the underlying buffer is allocated on first call to iobuf_push_*
 * and is enlarged each time it is necessary (thus, users do not have to compute
 * the size of the buffer to be allocated). iobuf_free() MUST be called to
 * release the memory. At anytime, the user can retrieve the content of the
 * buffer with the fields data and len.
 *
 * For reading, the caller has to set the fields data/data_size to the start/len
 * of the buffer he wants to parse. It is possible to have several iobufs
 * pointing to the same buffer (for nested structures). If an error (mostly a
 * buffer overflow) occurs during call of iobuf_pop_*(), 0 is returned and
 * iobuf.err is set. Thus, when parsing a series of fields, checking for
 * iobuf.err only once at the end is sufficient. One can additionally make sure
 * that there is no data remaining in the buffer using iobuf_remaining_size().
 *
 * The remaining data can be accessed without moving the read cursor using
 * iobuf_ptr() (and iobuf_remaining_size()).
