/**
 * Helpers to read and write configuration files. A configuration files a series
 * of key/values assignments with possible comments.
 *
 * All the data is provided by struct storage_parse_info. Fields file and
 * filename are filled by storage_open() (and storage_open_prefix()). These
 * fields are sufficient for write access.
 *
 * If storage_open() fail, error can be read from errno.
 *
 * To parse an existing file, parse_line() can be called until it returns EOF
 * (= -1). Function storage_parse_line() fills storage_parse_info with the
 * key/value couple it find. If a parse error happens, it returns < -1.
 *
 * In addition, if storage_parse_line() detects a number under brackets (like in
 * "gtk[0]"), the value under bracket is placed in key_array_index (otherwise,
 * key_array_index value is UINT_MAX)
